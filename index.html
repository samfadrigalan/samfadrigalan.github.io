        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Samantha Fadrigalan! I am a rising junior in Computer
          Science, with a minor in Math, at Louisiana State University. Geaux
          Tigers!
        </p>
        <p>
          I fell&mdash; or was pushed&mdash; into Computer Science in my junior year
          of high school. One of my math teachers tried to convince me to take
          her C++ class during the spring. I refused. However, that same teacher
          also happened to be my advisor, and had the power to schedule my
          classes. And so I had planned on bypassing her and
          drop the class the first week of the spring semester. Needless to say,
          I never did it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy enjoy volunteering and organizing
          outreach events. I'm a member of Society of Peer Mentors (SPM) at LSU,
          and I get to mentor local high school students during FIRST robotics
          season. I also co-founded a hackathon at LSU, <a href="geauxhack.com">
          GeauxHack</a>, with tons of help from SPM. I'm also an officer of
          the very new Women in Computer Science (WICS) organization at LSU. A
          bunch of us from SPM and WICS are planning a program to
          teach CS using Arduinos to secondary school girls. I also recently
           became president of Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) at LSU.
          If you would like to come join us for an ACM meeting, inquire about
          GeauxHack, or talk about anything from what I have mentioned, feel
          free to contact me!
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I will have my very first internship as a Consultant intern
          at Pariveda Solutions in Houston. I'm very excited start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from all things CS, I love music. I play guitar, piano, and sing,
           unafraid of how I sound. I often treat my musically talented friends
          as my personal band. I enjoy tasting new foods. I love taking walks outside
          if it's just about 60&deg;F and the sky is a shade of orange. I love learning
          about other cultures. I'm recentely entering a Marvel phase (MCU). I might
          delve into the comic books soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd like to come visit an ACM meeting, inquire about GeauxHack, or
          anything above, feel free to contact me. If you would just like to say hi,
          you can contact me too! I love meeting people. If you want to look at
          my code for this website, checkout my <a href="https://github.com/samfadrigalan">Github</a>. Thank you for reading
          this far. :)
