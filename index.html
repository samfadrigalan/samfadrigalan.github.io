        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Samantha Fadrigalan! I am a rising junior in Computer
          Science, with a minor in Math, at Louisiana State University. Geaux
          Tigers!
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in Computer Science started with my high school teacher
          in a small public boarding school in Louisiana. I took her Pre-Calculus
          class during the fall of junior year, and she later tried to convince
          me to take her C++ class the next semester. I refused. However, my
          opinion on that subject did not matter as she also happened to be my
          assigned advisor, and was in charge of my course schedule. I had planned
          on just taking the class for a week and somehow bypass her for the
          drop process. But, needless to say, I never did.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy enjoy volunteering and organizing
          outreach events. I'm a member of Society of Peer Mentors (SPM) at LSU,
          and I get to mentor local high school students during FIRST robotics
          season. I also co-founded a hackathon at LSU, <a href="geauxhack.com">
          GeauxHack</a>, with tons of help from SPM. I'm also an officer of
          the very new Women in Computer Science (WICS) organization at LSU. A
          bunch of us from SPM and WICS are also planning on having a program to
          teach CS using Arduinos to secondary school girls. And I also recently
           became president of Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) at LSU.
          If you would like to come join us for an ACM meeting, inquire about
          GeauxHack, or anything regarding the above, feel free to contact me!
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I will have my very first internship as a Consultant intern
          at Pariveda Solutions in Houston. I'm very excited to learn new things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from all things CS, I love music. I play guitar, piano, and sing
          unafraid of how I sound. I sometimes treat my musically talented friends
          as my personal band. I love tasting new foods. I like taking walks outside
          if it's just about 60&deg;F and the sky is a shade of orange. I love learning
          about other cultures. I'm recentely entering a Marvel phase (MCU). I might
          delve into the comic books soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd like to come visit an ACM meeting, inquire about GeauxHack, or
          anything above, feel free to contact me. If you would just like to say hi,
          you can contact me too! I love meeting people. If you want to look at
          my code for this website, checkout my Github. Thank you for reading
          this far. :)
